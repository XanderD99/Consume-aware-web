<h2>Université Savoie Mont Blanc</h2>
<p>
    Its mission is to develop—in collaboration with economic actors within the region (i.e., Haute Savoie and Savoie)—responsible managers and entrepreneurs, as well as strong engines for regional, national, and international businesses. The institute offers programmes from Bac +1 to Bac + 8.
</p>
<p>
    IAE Savoie Mont Blanc, through its research laboratory IREGE, pursues greater understanding of economic and management sciences. Student-researchers integrate their research work with their classroom assignments.
</p>
<p>
    The Institute works in constant collaboration with economic actors in the area who contribute to its development and from whom it takes its identity. In particular, IAE works with the Corporate Club, an innovative model of relations between businesses and universities.
    In offering career training dedicated to management, IAE Savoie Mont Blanc combines excellent teaching with access to the professional world. Due to its appealing geographic location (cross-border) and territorial dynamics, IAE has long benefitted from a programme that is open to international and differentiated (tourism, hospitality, event management) interests, spanning the vast range of regional training in management.
