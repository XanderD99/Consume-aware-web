<h2>Budapest Business School </h2>
<p>The Budapest Business School (in Hungarian Budapesti Gazdas&aacute;gi Egyetem from 2016) &ndash; as a government-run institution &ndash; was only created in 2000, as a result of a wide-ranging restructuring of the system of Hungarian higher education, three large business colleges, merged to form a leading business school. These were: the Faculty of Commerce, Catering and Tourism, the Faculty of International Management and Business Studies, and the Faculty of Finance and Accountaning. The origins of the three colleges constituting this new school can be tracked back over a century. BBS is the 3rd eldest Business School in Europe. With about 17.000 students, ours is Hungary&rsquo;s largest business college. And we look beyond that. Our vision is to become a leading institution of higher education in business studies and related areas. We are convinced that by pooling the resources of the colleges Budapest Business School has a chance to play a leading role in Hungary and the neighbouring regions in creating a business school that prepares students for the demands of an ever changing labour market. All of our academic programmes have been accredited by the competent Hungarian authorities. We take pride in these programmes since they effectively combine theory and practice.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of graduates from the BBS and its predecessors are much sought-after professionals in their respective fields and some of our alumni now occupy outstanding positions in the dynamically developing Hungarian business community as well as in the international business life. Independent surveys shows that employers and the labour market are satisfied with BBS graduates. BBS received the title of University of Applied Sciences in 2013. A 500-strong highly qualified faculty guarantees the high standards of professional education. They are assisted by hundreds of visiting professors and lecturers coming every year from abroad or from local companies to teach classes, give lectures or presentations to complement the work of staff members.</p>

<p>The Higher Education Quality Award was given by the Ministry of Education and Culture in 2010 in recognition of quality management activity of the Budapest Business School. Quality management system at the BBS was implemented step by step and even today it is under continuous development. As a result of the successful implementation of its quality development goals BBS acquired an ISO Certification in April 2012.</p>

<p>In the academic year 2006-2007, in the spirit of the Bologna process, Hungarian institutes of higher education, introduced the system of academic degrees with three levels (Bachelor&rsquo;s, Master&rsquo;s and Doctorate) thus making it easier to compare the degrees awarded. The Bologna process encourages student and staff mobility, and the establishment of cooperation agreements in the European Higher Educational Area. Students can now continue their studies in other higher educational institutions in different countries; can be sent abroad on placement (internship) and even start a career or a business in another EU member country. Range of Programmes:</p>

<p>BBS has 12 Bachelor&rsquo;s (BA/BSc) with 28 specialisations in 4 Colleges/Faculties, 8 Master&rsquo;s (MA/MSc) - Accounting, Finance, Entrepreneurship, International Relations (also in English), International Economics and Business (also in English), Marketing, Teacher Training and Tourism Management (also in English) - and 8 Higher Vocational Training Programmes, Doctorate Programme, Second- degree programmes and Lifelong Learning.</p>

<p>Our school attaches great importance to the international acceptance and validation of our programmes, diplomas and degrees. Different programmes established jointly with foreign universities make it possible for students from other countries to enrol in courses taught in foreign languages. Learning foreign languages, with special emphasis on the language of business, is a fundamental requirement for BBS students. BBS has an Institute of Foreign Languages that specialises in language teaching, examinations and teacher training. BBS has now 4 Bachelor&rsquo;s in English and German or French and 2 Master&rsquo;s in English. Besides BBS has programmes in cooperation with foreign partners.</p>

<p>BBS has become an integral part of international higher education and research. We have professional connections with more than 200 institutes of higher education in 46 countries. The various study trips, student and staff exchanges, joint research and educational programmes make it possible for the participating parties to share experiences and to adopt new teaching methods, materials, and technologies. BBS is member in the following international organisations: EUA, EURASHE, EDEN, IAU. It is also worth mentioning that our graduates often find employment with foreign businesses or multinational companies.</p>

<p>Both in initial education and continuing trainings BBS started to introduce innovative curricula for entrepreneurs. BBS participates in several international projects. </p>
